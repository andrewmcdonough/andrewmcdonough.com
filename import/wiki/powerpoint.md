====== Powerpoint ======
Powerpoint is a horrible horrible program.  I advise trying to avoid using it at all costs.  Consider writing presentations in XML with a nice Extensible Stylesheet to render.  That way you can properly separate the content from the presentation.

===== Changing the font of a link =====
Visited links in Powerpoint appear by default as a nasty grey/blue colour that isn't the most readable on a digital projector.  To change this to blue:

Format ->Slide Color Sheme ->
Change the colours of  Accent and Hyperlink and Accent and Followed Hyperlink
