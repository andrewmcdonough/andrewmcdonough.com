====== Groovy ======

  * Groovy is a computer programming language based on [[Java]].
  * The syntax is very similar to Java, but it also has some features commonly found in [[Ruby]], [[Python]] and [[Smalltalk]].
  * Groovy is compiled into [[JVM]] bytecode and can interact with Java classes.
  * Development in Groovy is potentially much faster than Java, because of its support for dynamic typing, and its build in syntax for arrays, lists, maps and regular expressions.
