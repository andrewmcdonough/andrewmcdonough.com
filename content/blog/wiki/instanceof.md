====== instanceof ======

In Java, instanceof is an operator to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class.

Note that this is **not a method** and is not to be confused with the method getInstanceOf() as found in the beans package.  The operator must be in **lower case** not camel case.

If an object o is of class B, and class B inherits from class A, then o is an instanceof A as well as B
