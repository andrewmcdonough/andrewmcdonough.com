## Identification of Fonts
For identication of fonts, or to find a font by name, use: http://www.identifont.com/

### Serif Fonts
Serifs are the small ticks at the end of letters.  Serif fonts use these ticks, and in printed media, can guide the reader's eye from one letter to the next.  I believe that serif fonts in screen media are too busy, and so these fonts should be reserved for print.  The classic example of a serif font is **Times New Roman**.


### Sans-Serif Fonts
Sans-serif fonts lack the small ticks at the end of the letters.  Traditionally, in print, these fonts were reserved for headlines.  In screen media, however, I believe these fonts look cleaner and are more readable.  Sans-serif fonts can be crudely broken down into the following sub-categories.:

^ Name ^ Description ^ Examples ^
^ Grotesque | Traditional sans-serif fonts. Straight with low variation of width. | Grotesque |
^ Neo-grotesque / Transitional | A more modern take on grotesque | Arial, Helvetica, Univers |
^ Humanist | A more moden class of san-serif, where letters have more varied widths | Johnson, Gill Sanes, Frutiger, Myriad, Segoe UI, Optima |
^ Geometric | Based on geometic shapes - lines and curves with first order continuity | Avant Garde, Century Gothic, Futura, Gotham, or Spartan |

## Core fonts for the web
Microsoft set up a commitee to decide the core fonts that should be supported by all web users.  The committee has since been disbanded.  The fonts were:
  * Andale Mono
  * Arial
  * Comic Sans MS
  * Courier New
  * Georgia
  * Impact
  * Times New Roman
  * Trebuchet MS
  * Verdana
  * Webdings

## Windows

  * The default Windows XP font is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoma|Tahoma]].  It is almost identical to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana|Verdana](/wiki/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tahoma|tahoma]].__it_is_almost_identical_to_[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verdana|verdana), but with tighter letter spacing.
  * The default font for Windows Vista will be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe_UI|Segoe UI]].  This is very similar to Trebuchet MS, which we use in many webapps at [[sportcentric](/wiki/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/segoe_ui|segoe_ui]].__this_is_very_similar_to_trebuchet_ms,_which_we_use_in_many_webapps_at_[[sportcentric).

It is claimed that Microsoft's Segoe UI and Adobe's Myriad are almost identical
