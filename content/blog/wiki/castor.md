# Castor

  * Castor is an [Open Source](/wiki/open_source) framework for moving data from XML documents into Java objects and relational databases.
  * This facilitates the serialization and deserialization of objects, so that they may be transported easily over any network.
  * As well as XML to Java binding, Castor provides persistence in the form of object to RDBMS mapping.
