# Groovy

  * Groovy is a computer programming language based on [Java](/wiki/java).
  * The syntax is very similar to Java, but it also has some features commonly found in [Ruby]], [[Python]] and [[Smalltalk](/wiki/ruby]],_[[python]]_and_[[smalltalk).
  * Groovy is compiled into [JVM](/wiki/jvm) bytecode and can interact with Java classes.
  * Development in Groovy is potentially much faster than Java, because of its support for dynamic typing, and its build in syntax for arrays, lists, maps and regular expressions.
