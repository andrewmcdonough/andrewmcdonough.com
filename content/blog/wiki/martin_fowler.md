# Martin Fowler

Martin Fowler is one of the best authors of [OOP]] books.  I recommend his books [[UML Distilled]] and [[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture]].  His website (http://www.martinfowler.com/) has fantastic explainations of [[Dependency Injection]] ([[Inversion of Control]]) and various important [[Design Patterns]].  His [[http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/|bliki](/wiki/oop]]_books.__i_recommend_his_books_[[uml_distilled]]_and_[[patterns_of_enterprise_application_architecture]].__his_website_(http://www.martinfowler.com/)_has_fantastic_explainations_of_[[dependency_injection]]_([[inversion_of_control]])_and_various_important_[[design_patterns]].__his_[[http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/|bliki) is definitely worth a read.
