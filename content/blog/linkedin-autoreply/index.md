# LinkedIn Messages

I'm trying to significantly reduce the time I spend on email, social media and messaging.

One of the plaforms where I get a lot of inbound connection requests and messages is LinkedIn.

I find filtering connection requests very time consuming, so I decided a while ago it was easiest to just accept all requests.

This does, however, mean I get a lot more messages, many of which are trying to sell me a product or service.

I don't really mind people using LinkedIn as a sales channel, but I don't have time to reply to all of these message individually.
